Creational responsibility needs to be implemented in a particular class. Because if we localize this logic in a particular class then that particular class can  be referred to as a  centralized location.

A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
In other words, subclasses are responsible for creating the instance of the class.

The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.

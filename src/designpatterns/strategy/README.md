Strategy Pattern
When we wish to have different types for something (eg. inserter , searcher as in this case ) and ensure that these types behave differently for the same function call.
The strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. 
Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.
